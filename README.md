# Get-Email-Script
This project automates the process of retrieving PDF attachments, such as resumes, from Gmail without the need to manually open the account. By leveraging the Gmail and Google Drive APIs, the script searches for emails containing PDF attachments, downloads the files, and automatically creates organized folders on Google Drive to store them. This eliminates manual effort, ensures efficient storage, and can be scheduled to run periodically for continuous automation.
